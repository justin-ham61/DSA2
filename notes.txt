Info
    3 Trucks
    2 Drivers
    40 packages/day
        each package has specific criteria and delivery requirements

Task
    Present a solution where all 40 packages will be delivered on time while meeting each package's requirements and keeping the combined total 
    distance traveled under 140 miles for all trucks combined.

    Delivery location in "Salt Lake City Downtown Map"
    Distance to each location in "WGUPS Distance Table"

More Info 
    Each truck can carry at most 16 packages
    Package has unique ID
    Average speed of 18 mph
    Inifite gas
    Each driver in same truck as long as the truck is in service
    Drivers can leave hub at 8AM at the earliest
    Can return to hub for packages if needed
    Up to one special note associated with a package
        Delivery address for package #9 is wrong and will be correct at 10:20am
        WGUPS is aware that the address is incorrect
        Does not know that the correct address should be "410 S. State St., Salt Lake City, UT 84111" until 10:20am
    Distance prvided in "WGUPS Distance Table"
    Day ends when all 40 packages have been delivered

Part A
    - Self Adjusting Algorithm:     
        - findNearestNeighbor
            - load all packages
                - 
    - Algorithm should select 


What needs to be done 
- load all package data
- load all distance data
- create class Address, Package
- Address should have address, set of nearest neighbor
- Package should have address, conditions
- Array of
